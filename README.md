Example of a conflict between Azure Spatial Anchors SDK 2.9.0 and App Center SDK 4.2.0. We reported this issue to both projects:

* AppCenter: https://github.com/microsoft/appcenter-sdk-unity/issues/496 - **The issue was resolve here.**
* Azure Spatial Anchors: https://github.com/Azure/azure-spatial-anchors-samples/issues/272

This repo is for testing the build process. The app will not work correctly.
The source code was taken from Azure Spatial Anchors Unity Sample https://github.com/Azure/azure-spatial-anchors-samples/tree/master/Unity
